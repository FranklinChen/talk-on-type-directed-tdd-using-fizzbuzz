## Talk: "Type-directed TDD with FizzBuzz"

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/talk-on-type-directed-tdd-with-fizzbuzz.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FranklinChen/talk-on-type-directed-tdd-with-fizzbuzz)

Presentation for Pittsburgh TechFest 2014, June 7, 2014.

### Abstract

(Note: this presentation will use live human volunteers to play the roles of various programming concepts.)

An expressive static type system is one of the most joyful and powerful tools for prototyping, designing, and maintaining programs. In this performance-theatrical presentation, I will provide a taste of how to use types, in conjunction with tests, to drive iterative development of a particular program, the famous FizzBuzz problem. We will solve generalizations of this problem, changing and adding requirements, to illustrate the pleasures and benefits of "type thinking".

The Scala language will be used the vehicle for this demonstration, but the techniques apply immediately to any industrial-strength statically typed language, such as Haskell, OCaml, F#, Rust, Swift.
